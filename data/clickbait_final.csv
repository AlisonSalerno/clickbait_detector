9386,2020-06-09 04:20:02+00:00,The hypocrisy from the left on this is truly staggering.
9387,2020-06-09 03:05:03+00:00,Whoopi Goldberg has taken her disdain for Trump way too far. She should not be using his Christian faith against him.
9388,2020-06-09 01:50:03+00:00,The New York Times can no longer be taken seriously as a legitimate news publication. Sad!

9428,2020-06-05 23:45:05+00:00,Drew Brees is being unfairly crucified simply for expressing his love for our anthem. I'm glad someone is finally standing up for him.
9429,2020-06-05 22:30:12+00:00,This is a huge victory for Trump and for America.
9430,2020-06-05 22:06:45+00:00,They crucify Drew Brees for loving the anthem but celebrate and promote this anti-America rhetoric. It's shameful!

9437,2020-06-05 15:10:06+00:00,"Antifa is a terrorist organization, and they will destroy America if we don't stop them."
9438,2020-06-05 13:53:40+00:00,Make no mistake: the chaos we are seeing right now was part of Obama's plan all along.
9439,2020-06-05 12:45:11+00:00,Pink is effectively saying that the millions of people who support Trump aren't really American. Who does she think she is?
9440,2020-06-05 12:00:49+00:00,This is so disturbing.

9454,2020-06-04 17:55:05+00:00,Barack Obama has no problem watching rioters destroy America. He's encouraging them.
9455,2020-06-04 17:39:41+00:00,I just got whiplash with how quickly Drew Brees became the 'enemy' and Colin Kaepernick a 'hero'. Cancel Culture practically crucified the guy.
9456,2020-06-04 16:49:11+00:00,It looks like someone is trying to save face here. But will Northam's radical agenda sit well with the citizens of Virginia?

9461,2020-06-04 12:40:05+00:00,Governor Cuomo has been disrespecting the NYPD for far too long. They aren't taking it lying down anymore.
9462,2020-06-04 11:50:05+00:00,"Democrats are destroying America, and our enemies are loving watching it happen."
9463,2020-06-04 11:05:09+00:00,"Antifa is a terrorist organization, and this is how they are indoctrinating our children."
9464,2020-06-04 04:30:08+00:00,"This woman lives in La La land. There is nothing ""peaceful"" about the protesters outside the White House."
9465,2020-06-04 03:20:03+00:00,"Enough is enough. It's time for this nonsense to end, and Trump is the only one who can put a stop to it."
9466,2020-06-04 02:20:02+00:00,Rod Rosenstein's testimony was an absolute train wreck for the left. The truth has finally come out.

9473,2020-06-03 19:15:09+00:00,These riots have gone way too far. America as we know it is at risk of being destroyed forever.

9483,2020-06-03 02:05:02+00:00,"Trump is letting Antifa know that he is not afraid, and that he will not let them destroy America."
9484,2020-06-03 01:10:05+00:00,This no-nonsense sheriff is sending a message to rioters everywhere that they should think twice before looting his city.
